## Project Description

This project aims to compare different sorting functions using the C language. An executable, `tri.exe`, has been created to perform these comparisons.

## Usage Instructions

1. Navigate to the "bin" directory where the `tri.exe` executable is located.
2. Run the program by double-clicking the executable or using the command line.

## Sorting Functions Comparison

The program allows the comparison of various sorting functions, analyzing their performance in terms of execution time.

## Using Gnuplot

We have used Gnuplot to generate graphs and visualizations from the sorting functions comparison data. You can refer to these graphs for a visual analysis of the sorting functions' performance.
